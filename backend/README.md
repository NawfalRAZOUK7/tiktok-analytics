# Project: TikTok Analytics â€” Backend (Django)

**Purpose:** Future REST API for ingesting and analyzing TikTok data (views/likes/engagement trends), based on an exported JSON file.

**Scope Now:** Scaffold only; no code implemented.

## Next Steps (later):

- Set up Django apps for ingest, analytics, auth.
- Wire up DRF, pagination, filters.
- Add env-based settings split (dev/prod), logging, CORS for Flutter.

**TikTok JSON reference:** an exported JSON file will be used as the initial data source (see ROADMAP.md for details).
