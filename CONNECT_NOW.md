---

## üìù Quick Steps to Connect

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to: **https://github.com/new**

Fill in:

- **Repository name:** `tiktok-analytics` (or your preferred name)
- **Description:** `Full-stack TikTok analytics app with Django backend and Flutter frontend`
- **Visibility:** Choose **Public** ‚úÖ or **Private** üîí
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT check** "Initialize with README" (we already have one!)

Click **"Create repository"**

---

### 2. Connect and Push

GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead (customized for you):

```bash
# Replace YOUR_REPO_NAME with the name you chose
git remote add origin https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (if you named it `tiktok-analytics`):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/tiktok-analytics.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 3. Authenticate

When prompted for credentials:

- **Username:** `NawfalRAZOUK7`
- **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)

#### Don't have a token? Create one:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Name: "TikTok Analytics"
3. Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
4. Select scope: ‚úÖ **repo** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_...`) and save it securely
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

---

### 4. Verify Connection

After pushing successfully:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Should show:

```
origin  https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git (push)
```

Visit your repository on GitHub to see all files! üéâ

---

## üéØ What Gets Pushed

‚úÖ All scaffold files (Django + Flutter)  
‚úÖ Documentation (README.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.)  
‚úÖ Environment templates (.env.example files)  
‚úÖ Schema definition (schema.json, sample.json, SCHEMA.md)  
‚úÖ Git configuration (.gitignore)

‚ùå NOT pushed (protected by .gitignore):

- `.env` files (if you create them)
- Database files (db.sqlite3)
- Your real TikTok export data
- Python cache, build files

---

## üí° Alternative: GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed:

```bash
# One command to create repo and push
gh repo create tiktok-analytics --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Or for private repo
gh repo create tiktok-analytics --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Make sure you're using a **Personal Access Token**, not your password
- Token must have `repo` scope

### "Repository already exists"

- Choose a different name or delete the existing repo

### "Remote already exists"

```bash
git remote remove origin
# Then try adding it again
```

---

## üìö After Connecting

Once your repo is on GitHub, you can:

1. **Share your work** with the repository URL
2. **Track issues** using GitHub Issues
3. **Collaborate** by inviting contributors
4. **Set up CI/CD** for automated testing/deployment
5. **Add a GitHub Actions** workflow

---

## ‚ú® Next Command (After Connecting)

Run this to mark the task complete:

```bash
# This will be in the next step after GitHub connection
```
