# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - CI/CD Setup

## ✅ What's Already Done

Your CI/CD pipelines are **fully configured and pushed to GitHub**. All 5 workflows are ready to run!

---

## 📋 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Replace GitHub Username in Badges

Open `README.md` and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Current (line 3-6 in README.md):
[![Backend CI/CD](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SocialMedia/...

# Replace with:
[![Backend CI/CD](https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/tiktok-analytics/...
```

**Your username:** `NawfalRAZOUK7`  
**Repository name:** `tiktok-analytics`

### Step 2: Verify Workflows Are Active

1. Go to: https://github.com/NawfalRAZOUK7/tiktok-analytics/actions
2. You should see 5 workflows listed:
   - ✅ Backend CI/CD
   - ✅ Frontend CI/CD  
   - ✅ Docker Build & Push
   - ✅ Dependency Updates
   - ✅ Pull Request Checks

3. Click on any workflow to see runs
4. Workflows will trigger automatically on next push

### Step 3: Enable Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule**
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
4. Select these status checks:
   - `Test Backend`
   - `Test Frontend`
   - `Security Scan`
5. Click **Create**

### Step 4: Create Environments

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**
2. Create three environments:

#### **staging**
- Name: `staging`
- URL: `https://staging.yourdomain.com` (optional)
- Protection rules: None (for now)

#### **production**
- Name: `production`  
- URL: `https://yourdomain.com` (optional)
- Protection rules:
  - ✅ Required reviewers: 1
  - ✅ Wait timer: 5 minutes

#### **frontend-production**
- Name: `frontend-production`
- URL: `https://app.yourdomain.com` (optional)
- Protection rules: Same as production

## 🔐 Configure Secrets (When Ready to Deploy)

Go to: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

### Essential Secrets (for deployment)

Only add these when you're ready to deploy:

|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `PRODUCTION_API_URL` | `https://api.yourdomain.com/api` | Production deploy |
| `FIREBASE_TOKEN` | Run: `firebase login:ci` | Firebase deploy |
| `NETLIFY_TOKEN` | From Netlify dashboard | Netlify deploy |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | From codecov.io | Coverage reports |

### Optional Secrets

Add these if you use these platforms:

| Secret Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `HEROKU_API_KEY` | Heroku deployment |
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway deployment |

## 🧪 Test Your CI/CD Pipeline

### Method 1: Create a Test PR

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-cicd

# Make a small change
echo "# Test CI/CD" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin test-cicd

# Go to GitHub and create a PR
# Watch the workflows run!
```

### Method 2: Push to Main

```bash
# Make any change
git add .
git commit -m "fix: update readme badges"
git push origin main

# Go to Actions tab to see workflows running
```

   - Builds and validates
   - **Deploys to production** (main) or **staging** (develop)

2. **Frontend workflow runs:**
   - Tests Flutter code
   - Checks formatting (dart format)
   - Builds web app
   - Builds Android APK

   - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
   - Scans for vulnerabilities
   - Tags: `latest`, `main`, `main-abc123`

### On Every Pull Request:

1. **PR checks run:**
   - Validates PR title format
   - Auto-labels based on files
   - Adds size label (XS, S, M, L, XL)
   - Checks for merge conflicts

2. **Backend & Frontend tests run**
3. **Coverage reports generated**

### Every Monday at 9 AM UTC:

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: View Workflow Logs
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# View workflow runs
gh run list
gh run view <run-id>
```

### Tip 2: Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Install 'act' to run workflows locally
brew install act

# Run a workflow
act -j test
```

### Tip 3: Disable Workflows Temporarily
```bash
# Add to workflow file:
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
```

### Tip 4: Skip CI on Commits
```bash
# Add to commit message:
git commit -m "docs: update readme [skip ci]"
```
